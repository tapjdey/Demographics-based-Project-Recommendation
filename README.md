# Timezone-based-Project-Recommendation

Here we are showing the most popular projects (in terms of the number of contributors) in the user's Time Zone and the nearby Time Zones (User's Time Zone Â± 2 Hours). 
            
We show two Tables - The top one with popular projects in the user's own Time Zone, the bottom one with popular projects in nearby TimeZones.

The `.json` file contains processed data from [World of Code](https://worldofcode.org/), which is the source dataset for this project.

The app is built using `Python` `Streamlit`. More details available on the app page.
